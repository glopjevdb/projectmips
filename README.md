# projectmips

## Launch
I used a MIPS emulator called MARS.
To launch in Mars:
1. Enable that all files in the same directory are built.
2. To control your "block" yourself, you can launch `maze.asm`
3. To use the simple "homemade" dfs to find the exit, you can launch `maze_extension.asm`

You an also create your own maps using the following the legend:
- `w`: A wall
- `p`: A passage
- `u`: An exit
